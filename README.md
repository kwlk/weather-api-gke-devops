# 🌦️ Weather API

### Project Report - DevOps Workflow with GKE, Cloud Build, and GitOps

---
 
## Project description

Weather API is a simple REST application written in Java (Spring Boot) that exposes weather data.
The project demonstrates a complete DevOps pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using: 

- 🏗️ **Terraform** - infrastructure as code (IaC)
- 🧊 **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** for running the application in containers
- 🔧 **Cloud Build** for automated Docket image building and deployment
- 📦 **Artifact Registry** as the Docket image repository
- 🔁 **GitOps approach**, enabling automatic deployments after each push to the repository
- 📊 **Cloud Monitoring** (Logging i Metrics) for observing the application and infrastructure
- 🔐 IAM for controlling access to the cluster and CI/CD pipeline

---

## 💻 How to Run the Application locally

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joannawalach1/weather-api-gke-devops.git
```
---
## 🏗️ Infrastructure Provisioning
All infrastructure required for the project is created automatically using **Terraform**, stored in the **`infra/`** directory.
The code is modular, clear, and fully version-controlled.

### 📁 Terraform project structure
The Terraform configuration is divided into modular files:

- **artifact-registry.tf** – Artifact Registry repository for Docker images  
- **backend.tf** – configuration for Terraform **remote backend storing the state in a GCS bucket**
- **gke.tf** – GKE cluster + node pool  
- **iam.tf** – IAM roles
- **network.tf** – VPC, subnet
- **main.tf** – root config  
- **variables.tf** – variable definitions  
- **trigger_sa.tf** - service account for the Cloud Build Trigger
- **terraform.tfvars** – variable values that doesnt need to be hidden

### 🚫 Not Managed by Terraform
Some resources was created manually:

- **Cloud Build Trigger** - GitHub connection requires browser-based OAuth authorization
- **GCS Bucket for Terraform Backend** - The bucket used to store Terraform state remotely must exist before Terraform is initialized

## 🗂️ Artifact Registry

Artifact Registry is used as the container image repository for the project.  
Cloud Build pushes each newly built Docker image into the repository using the commit's `SHORT_SHA` as the tag.  
This ensures versioned, traceable images and enables smooth rollouts on GKE.

---

## ⚙️ Cloud Build – Continuous Integration & Deployment
Cloud Build is responsible for the complete CI/CD process of the Weather API project. It is automatically triggered by a **push trigger** connected to the main branch of the repository. The trigger watches for code changes and, whenever a new commit is pushed, it launches the pipeline responsible for building and deploying the application. The trigger executes builds using a custom Service Account (cloudbuild-trigger-sa), to ensure that only minimal permissions are granted.

### 🔄 Pipeline Overview
The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Builds the Java application** using Maven  
2. **Creates a Docker image** tagged with the commit SHA  
3. **Pushes the image** to Artifact Registry  
4. **Authenticates with the GKE cluster**  
5. **Applies Kubernetes manifests** from the `k8s/` directory  
6. **Updates the deployment** to use the newly built image  
7. **Triggers a rolling update** in GKE  

This provides a clean **GitOps workflow**:  
> **commit → build → push → deploy**

### 🔐 IAM Permissions for CI/CD
To allow Cloud Build to push images and deploy them to GKE, several IAM roles were assigned to the Cloud Build service account:

- **roles/artifactregistry.writer** – allows pushing Docker images to Artifact Registry  
- **roles/container.developer** – allows deploying workloads to the GKE cluster (`kubectl apply`, updating Deployments)  
- **roles/container.clusterViewer** (optional) – grants read access to cluster metadata when required

## ⚙️ **Kubernetes Manifests**

### 📦 **Deployment (`weather-api`)**
The Deployment defines how the application runs inside the GKE cluster.  
It uses the container image built in Cloud Build and includes two key health checks:

- **Readiness Probe**  
  Ensures the pod is ready to receive traffic  
  (`/actuator/health/readiness`)

- **Liveness Probe**  
  Ensures the application stays healthy and restarts if needed  
  (`/actuator/health/liveness`)

### 🌐 **Service (`LoadBalancer`)**
A Service of type **LoadBalancer** exposes the application publicly.

- Maps external port **80** to container port **8081**
- Automatically provisions a Google Cloud external load balancer
- Routes traffic to pods labeled `app: weather-api`

This provides a stable public endpoint for accessing the Weather API.
